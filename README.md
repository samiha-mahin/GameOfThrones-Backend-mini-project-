 This is a mini backend project of CRUD operations with fun concepts! This mini-project I built with using Node.js, Express.js, EJS, and MongoDB! 🌐 Built a 'High-lords Profile Creating Website' inspired by “Game of Thrones”, where users can create profiles for the Seven Kingdoms. A great hands-on experience with backend development and database integration. Always exciting to bring the world of Westeros to life through code! ⚔️🐉 Game of Thrones fans welcome!
